<!-- // to work in DOM we have to work in HTML file. -->
<!-- DOM stands for document object model. -->
<!-- document is made up of which model , what is it's structure , how does the page looks -->

<!-- 1. open a wiki page in browser . console.log(window)
=> drop down the arrow --

2console.log(document) , here we have the DOM (document object modelling) where we have the HEAD & BODY. 

we donot get everything like in windows , in documents we get only the filtered things where we will work on the document object modelling -->

<!-- after the diagram in the copy -->

<!-- console.log(document.)  -->
<!-- after that dot we can see there are many functions or methods which we can use for eg. document.baseURI -->

<!-- (document.getElementById()) by this we can choose a targeted element with the help of it's id and manipulate it  -->
